Study Assist is a browser extension which offers a way to organise your bookmarks based on the content of the pages you visit.
The extension brings automation in categorising online sources, and is ideal for users who need to maintain an organised bookmarks repository, such as students, researchers, developers, etc.

Study Assist analyses the content of the page you are currently visiting, and makes suggestions of the possible categories to save the page under.
The analysis also returns tags to attach to the bookmark, to make it easier for the user to find later.
