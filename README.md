# study-assist

A program that analyses text and attaches topic and mood badges to it. The project would explore how we can use Natural Language Processing in Javascript.

Problem Solved: Help students & researchers to label/categorise online content or their own content.

## MVP

A text content labeling browser add-on. The plugin attaches topic and mood badges to text content on a visited page.
The project would be built as an API which receives text content and returns label information.

**Technologies**
HTML/CSS/JavaScript
JS Machine Learning libraries
NodeJS
(MongoDB?)

## Possible Extensions

- Suggest related content found online, and possibly suggest actions based on the text analysis
- Analyse user's notes in a browser notes app
- Explore the relation between topic and mood to elaborate more detailed insights on the content
- Memorize topics for insights on recurrent research topics (statistical insight of visited pages) (automatically generated study diary)
