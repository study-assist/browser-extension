#### [!] This project is no longer in development

Study Assist is a browser extension designed to help you scan web pages and store them in your browser bookmarks. It brings automation for reading and categorising online content, and is ideal for users who need to maintain an organised bookmarks repository.

Study Assist analyses the content of your active tab, and returns suggestions of tags and folders in which to save the bookmark. You can also use it as simple web page scanner for a quick overview of the overall sentiment and emotions of the content.

There are a lot of bookmarks managers to choose from. In comparison to the [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) or [Mix](https://mix.com/) applications, which operate on their own separate storage space, [Study Assist](https://study-assist-vincentreynaud.study-assist-webext.now.sh/) is built as an interface to the bookmarks API to keep bookmarks easily accessible and editable without having to use the extension.

- our service delivers analysis from IBM's Natural Language Processing API, Watson.
